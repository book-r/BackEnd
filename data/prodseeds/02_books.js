Tracing the exchange of ideas among history's key philosophers, The Great Conversation: A Historical Introduction to Philosophy, Sixth Edition, demonstrates that while constructing an argument or making a claim, one philosopher almost always has others in mind. The book addresses the fundamental questions of human life: Who are we? What can we know? How should we live? and What sort of reality do we inhabit?"

        description: "This book is based upon lecture notes developed by Jack Kiefer for a course in statistical inference he taught at Cornell University. The notes were distributed to the class in lieu of a textbook, and the problems were used for homework assignments. Relying only on modest prerequisites of probability theory and calculus, Kiefer's approach to a first course in statistics is to present the central ideas of the modem mathematical theory with a minimum of fuss and formality. He is able to do this by using a rich mixture of examples, pictures, and math­ ematical derivations to complement a clear and logical discussion of the important ideas in plain English. The straightforwardness of Kiefer's presentation is remarkable in view of the sophistication and depth of his examination of the major theme: How should an intelligent person formulate a statistical problem and choose a statistical procedure to apply to it? Kiefer's view, in the same spirit as Neyman and Wald, is that one should try to assess the consequences of a statistical choice in some quantitative (frequentist) formulation and ought to choose a course of action that is verifiably optimal (or nearly so) without regard to the perceived attractiveness of certain dogmas and methods."

Fundamental principles are covered, quantum theory is presented, and special techniques are developed for attacking realistic problems. The innovative two-part coverage is entertaining and informative, organizing topics under basic theory and assembling an arsenal of approximation schemes with illustrative applications linked closely to the text."

The authors' enthusiasm for their subject is compelling as they present abstract concepts in a humorous and easy-to-grasp fashion. Together, these books will open new doors of thought to anyone who wants to find out what computing is really about. The Little Schemer introduces computing as an extension of arithmetic and algebra; things that everyone studies in grade school and high school. It introduces programs as recursive functions and briefly discusses the limits of what computers can do. The authors use the programming language Scheme, and interesting foods to illustrate these abstract ideas. The Seasoned Schemer informs the reader about additional dimensions of computing: functions as values, change of state, and exceptional cases. The Little LISPer has been a popular introduction to LISP for many years. It had appeared in French and Japanese. The Little Schemer and The Seasoned Schemer are worthy successors and will prove equally popular as textbooks for Scheme courses as well as companion texts for any complete introductory course in Computer Science."

A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises. In addition, all the programs have been reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE standard."

This new fifth edition has become more than a textbook for the basic linear algebra course. That is its first purpose and always will be. The new chapters about applications of the SVD, probability and statistics, and Principal Component Analysis in finance and genetics, make it also a textbook for a second course, plus a resource at work. Linear algebra has become central in modern applied mathematics. This book supports the value of understanding linear algebra.

Introduction to Linear Algebra, Fifth Edition includes challenge problems to complement the review problems that have been highly praised in previous editions. The basic course is followed by eight applications: differential equations in engineering, graphs and networks, statistics, Fourier methods and the FFT, linear programming, computer graphics, cryptography, Principal Component Analysis, and singular values.`

        description: `Rust is a new systems programming language that combines the performance and low-level control of C and C++ with memory safety and thread safety. Rust’s modern, flexible types ensure your program is free of null pointer dereferences, double frees, dangling pointers, and similar bugs, all at compile time, without runtime overhead. In multi-threaded code, Rust catches data races at compile time, making concurrency much easier to use.

Written by two experienced systems programmers, this book explains how Rust manages to bridge the gap between performance and safety, and how you can take advantage of it. Topics include:

    - How Rust represents values in memory (with diagrams)
    - Complete explanations of ownership, moves, borrows, and lifetimes
    - Cargo, rustdoc, unit tests, and how to publish your code on crates.io, Rust’s public package repository
    - High-level features like generic code, closures, collections, and iterators that make Rust productive and flexible
    - Concurrency in Rust: threads, mutexes, channels, and atomics, all much safer to use than in C or C++
    - Unsafe code, and how to preserve the integrity of ordinary code that uses it
    - Extended examples illustrating how pieces of the language fit together`
